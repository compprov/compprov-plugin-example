## OBJECTIVE
Analyze the computation graph (`<CPG>`) provided in the system message to detect potential **Topological Accumulation Fraud via Double Counting** attacks, where valid, origin entities are fed into aggregation nodes via duplicate or parallel causal paths to artificially manipulate consolidated financial metrics—either inflating reported revenues/assets or deflating taxable income/liabilities.

## ATTACK VECTOR DEFINITION: Topological Accumulation Fraud via Double Counting
Topological Accumulation Fraud occurs when an adversary exploits the scale and complexity of a computational graph to reuse the same real, legitimate entity — an inflow/revenue value **or a cost/deduction value** — across multiple execution paths that both ultimately affect the same downstream financial result. This is the identical fraud shape whether the duplicated entity adds to a total twice (inflating it) or subtracts from a total twice (deflating it); do not treat one direction as more suspicious than the other. Common mechanisms: mapping a single source variable into both a primary calculation path and a secondary, look-alike path that both feed the same rollup; routing a single entity through multiple distinct intermediate operations before aggregating them; concealing the reuse inside a dense, high-node-count topology where local replay confirms each node independently but misses the global overlap; re-wrapping a variable through an identity/passthrough operation to assign it a new `track.id` while retaining the same underlying reference; or — the deduction-side mirror of the above — netting a cost out of one branch's intermediate subtotal, then subtracting that *same* cost again from a later aggregate that already incorporates that subtotal.

Trace all directed paths from each root input forward to the graph's *true terminal output* — do not stop at the first aggregation/rollup operation encountered. An intermediate subtotal can itself be consumed again by a later aggregation or adjustment step, and reuse at that later step is just as much a duplication as reuse at the first one. Count the path multiplicity $M(V_{in}, Op_{agg})$ all the way to the terminal output, whether the value contributes there as a positive addend or a subtracted deduction — multiplicity greater than 1 without an explicit split/allocation rule is the anomaly, regardless of direction.

## USING THE STRUCTURAL REFERENCE DATA
Of the sets provided in the system message under STRUCTURAL REFERENCE DATA, the **variable IDs consumed as an argument by more than one operation** are relevant to this task — use them to focus the path-multiplicity analysis above. This is a structural fact, not a verdict; reuse alone does not by itself indicate fraud. For each ID, determine whether the reuse is a legitimate shared parameter/allocation or genuine double-counting into the same aggregation node — and continue checking for duplication this list would not catch, such as the same underlying entity re-entered under a different variable ID (Origin ID / Hash Aliasing).

<EXPECTED_INVARIANTS>
- Path multiplicity $M(V_{in}, Op_{agg})$ for any financial input entity into the terminal output — whether contributing as an addend or as a deduction — must equal $1$. A single root financial asset, transaction entity, or cost/deduction must not contribute its value multiple times to an additive or subtractive rollup unless explicit, auditable proportional splitting logic is documented.
- Deduplicated sum $S_{dedup}$ (each unique root entity counted once) must match the reported consolidation $S_{reported}$.
- Re-wrapping or cloning an intermediate variable does not grant it unique entity status if its lineage traces back to a previously consumed root entity; intermediate alias nodes must preserve original entity tracking metadata to prevent duplicate path masking.
- A cost, fee, or deduction that has already been netted into an intermediate subtotal must not be subtracted again from a later aggregate that already incorporates that subtotal.
