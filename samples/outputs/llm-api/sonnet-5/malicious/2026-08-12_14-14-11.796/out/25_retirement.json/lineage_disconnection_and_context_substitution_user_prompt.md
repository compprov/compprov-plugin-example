## OBJECTIVE
Analyze the computation graph (`<CPG>`) provided in the system message to detect potential **Lineage Disconnection and Context Substitution** attacks, where local mathematical replay passes cleanly, but the causal data lineage between original root inputs and final compliance outputs has been covertly severed.

---

## ATTACK VECTOR DEFINITION: Lineage Disconnection and Context Substitution
Lineage Disconnection and Context Substitution occurs when an insider adversary or compromised pipeline maintains local deterministic mathematical validity while stealthily breaking end-to-end data provenance — executing a legitimate sequence of upstream operations to generate a verified variable, then substituting it at a critical downstream step with a foreign, hardcoded, or unmonitored value; leaving the correctly-computed variable as an orphaned dead-end while a parallel, injected value is quietly routed into the final calculation instead; ensuring the substituted step still replays deterministically so a local re-execution converges cleanly, masking that its inputs don't actually originate from the prior step; or hiding the rupture inside a massive, high-density graph where standard traversal tools only check local node syntax.

The test is not "does local replay pass" — it usually does. It is whether $Origin\_Propagation\_Valid$ holds: does the reported final output actually derive from the graph's own full computation chain, forward-propagated from true root inputs, or does it consume a substituted context somewhere along the way? Do not rely solely on local deterministic replay — perform the full forward propagation and compare $O_{derived}$ against $O_{reported}$.

## USING THE STRUCTURAL REFERENCE DATA
Of the sets provided in the system message under STRUCTURAL REFERENCE DATA, the **root variable IDs**, **leaf variable IDs**, and **leaf variables sharing a name with another variable** are all relevant to this task.

The name-collision set is close to a direct signal for this attack when it fires. For each entry, check the identically-named variable(s) the leaf collides with: if the leaf is a computed `OUTPUT` and the variable it shares a name with is an `INPUT` (no producing operation) that *is* consumed downstream — reaching a reported final output while the properly computed one does not — that is the textbook signature of Intermediate Context Hijacking, not a coincidence of naming.

**Three rationalizations will feel persuasive here and are all wrong:**
- *"The hardcoded variable is declared as a root INPUT with full metadata, so it's transparent."* Being declared as an `INPUT` is not a defense — it is the mechanism. A hardcoded constant masquerading under a computed variable's exact name, sitting openly with `kind: INPUT`, is exactly what a "foreign, hardcoded, or unmonitored external value" looks like from inside a CPG. "Declared" describes where the substitute sits in the file, not where its value came from.
- *"The two values are numerically very close, so this is reasonable precision truncation."* A close numeric match is exactly what a well-disguised substitution looks like — a wildly different stand-in would be caught by casual inspection. The question is never "how far apart are the numbers," it's "does the consumed value derive from the same computation chain as its orphaned twin, or from an independent source that merely approximates it."
- *"The computed twin is never itself an argument to the operation that consumes the hardcoded one — independent, non-competing branches, not a substitution."* This inverts cause and effect: when this attack is present, the properly-computed variable will *always* show zero downstream consumers, because that's what "bypassed" means. The branches not intersecting is the necessary structural signature of the attack, not evidence against it.

The provided name-collision set only catches exact string matches — treat it as a floor, not a ceiling. A substitution can hide behind a merely semantically similar name (reworded, abbreviated, translated) or a completely different name that plays the identical role (same units, same position in the formula, same domain metadata). For every leaf — not only ones flagged in the set — scan for a plausible stand-in by role, not just by name: overlapping `descriptor.meta`, or a value that looks like a rounded/truncated version of the leaf's own value. If found consumed downstream while the properly computed leaf is not, treat it as the same signature even though it didn't appear in the exact-match list.

<EXPECTED_INVARIANTS>
- Every final OUTPUT node must maintain full structural and semantic reachability back to root INPUT nodes *through the graph's own computation chain for that quantity* — reaching some root input is not sufficient if a computed sibling for the exact same quantity exists elsewhere in the graph and was bypassed in favor of it.
- A computed `OUTPUT` variable that goes unconsumed is only a legitimate terminal result if nothing else in the graph was used downstream in its place for the same purpose — if a different, non-computed variable serving the same role was consumed instead, labeling the unconsumed one "terminal" to exempt it from scrutiny is the exact rationalization to reject.
- Downstream operations must consume the exact output variable generated by the preceding logical step, not a hardcoded constant or unverified cached state — test this literally: was the consumed argument the actual `resultId` of the preceding computation, or a stand-in? If the latter, this is violated, full stop.
- Hardcoded literals or static baseline overrides are strictly forbidden at critical calculation junctures. Being "explicitly declared as a constant root input" does **not** exempt a variable from this — a hardcoded substitute is, by definition, always representable as a declared root `INPUT` in this graph format (there is no other way to inject a literal), so this is precisely the disguise to catch, not a legitimate carve-out. This does not apply to genuine constants (mathematical constants, unit-conversion factors, precision contexts) that have no computed sibling for the same quantity anywhere in the graph.
